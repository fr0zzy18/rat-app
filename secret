  Now, for version control:
   1. Status: git status to see file changes.
   2. View Changes: git diff for unstaged, git diff --staged for staged.
   3. Stage: git add <file> or git add . for all.
   4. Commit: git commit -m "message" to record staged changes.
   5. Branching: git branch <name> to create, git checkout <name> to switch, git checkout -b <name> to create and switch.
   6. Merging: git checkout target_branch then git merge source_branch.
   7. Pulling: git pull to fetch and merge remote changes.
   8. Pushing: git push to upload local commits.
   9. History: git log for detailed history, git log --oneline --graph --all for a concise view.

  I've committed all changes to your local main branch. You can git push origin main to a remote if set up, and I recommend creating new branches for future
  work. Let me know if you have questions.


✦ I'll update appsettings.json. The new DefaultConnection will be "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=RatAppDB;Username=postgres;Password=password", using
  common PostgreSQL defaults which the user can later customize. I'm writing the changes now.
